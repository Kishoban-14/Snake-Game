A C++ implementation of the classic Snake Game, developed using fundamental Object Oriented Design principles to ensure code modularity and scalability. This project contains dynamic memory allocation and management for snake body growth, collision detection, and gameplay state management. Designed with a structured class architecture to improve code maintainability and to accomodate future feature expansion. Test-driven development practices were implemented to validate core gameplay functionalities during the development process
